	!DOCKER ENGINE: is a lightweight tool that binde my app and its dependencies into a single package called container.
	?DOCKER ENGINE containes:
	!DOCKER DAEMON: a background process that manages containers(run, build, stop, delete)
	!DOCKER CLI: a tool to interact with docker daemon.
	?Here's how docker engine works:
	*write dockerfiles.
	*build docker image[a leightweight executable package that include everything needed to run a piece of software] (docker build).
	*run docker image as container (docker run).
	*(the docker engine provide a secure isolated environment for the container to run in).
	*manage the container from th CLI

	!differences between DOCKERFILE & DOCKER compose
	*dockerfile: is a text file containing instructions forr building docker images
	*docker compose : YAML file used to define how multiple containers should be set up and run
