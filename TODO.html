	?DOCKER ENGINE containes:
	!DOCKER DAEMON: a background process that manages containers(run, build, stop, delete)
	!DOCKER CLI: a tool to interact with docker daemon.

	*write dockerfiles.
	*build docker image[a leightweight executable package that include everything needed to run a piece of software] (docker build).
	*run docker image as container (docker run).
